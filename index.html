<h3>Defining the video game</h3>
<p id="list">The term video game has evolved over the decades from a purely technical definition to a general concept defining a new class of interactive entertainment. Technically, for a product to be a video game, there must be a video signal transmitted to a cathode ray tube (CRT) that creates a rasterized image on a screen. This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or teletype rather than a display, any game rendered on a vector-scan monitor, any game played on a modern high definition display, and most handheld game systems. From a technical standpoint, these would more properly be called "electronic games" or "computer games."
Today, however, the term "video game" has completely shed its purely technical definition and encompasses a wider range of technology. While still rather ill-defined, the term "video game" now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates an element of interactivity and outputs the results of the player's actions to a display. Going by this broader definition, the first video games appeared in the early 1950s and were tied largely to research projects at universities and large corporations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games" target="_blank">Wiki</a></p>
<h3>Brief history of video games</h3>
<p>The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations as part of their research. Video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s, when video arcade games and gaming consoles using joysticks, buttons, and other controllers, along with graphics on computer screens and home computer games were introduced to the general public. Since the 1980s, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern popular culture in most parts of the world. One of the early games was Spacewar!, which was developed by computer scientists. Early arcade video games developed from 1972 to 1978. During the 1970s, the first generation of home consoles emerged, including the popular game Pong and various "clones". The 1970s was also the era of mainframe computer games. The golden age of arcade video games was from 1978 to 1982. Video arcades with large, graphics-decorated coin-operated machines were common at malls and popular, affordable home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision enabled people to play games on their home TVs. During the 1980s, gaming computers, early online gaming and handheld LCD games emerged; this era was affected by the video game crash of 1983. From 1976 to 1992, the second generation of video consoles emerged.
The third generation of consoles, which were 8-bit units, emerged from 1983 to 1995. The fourth generation of consoles, which were 16-bit models, emerged from 1987 to 1999. The 1990s saw the resurgence and decline of arcades, the transition to 3D video games, improved handheld games, and PC gaming. The fifth generation of consoles, which were 32 and 64-bit units, was from 1993 to 2006. During this era, mobile phone gaming emerged. During the 2000s, the sixth generation of consoles emerged (1998–2013). During this period, online gaming and mobile games became major aspects of gaming culture. The seventh generation of consoles was from 2005 to 2012. This era was marked by huge development budgets for some games, with some having cinematic graphics; the launch of the top-selling Wii console, in which the user could control the game actions with real-life movement of the controller; the rise of casual PC games marketed to non-gamers and the emergence of cloud computing in video games.
In 2013, the eighth generation of consoles emerged, including Nintendo's Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, Microsoft's Xbox One, and Sony's PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. PC gaming has been holding a large market share in Asia and Europe for decades and continues to grow due to digital distribution. Since the development and widespread consumer use of smartphones, mobile gaming has been a driving factor for games, as they can reach people formerly uninterested in gaming, and those unable to afford or support dedicated hardware, such as video game consoles. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games" target="_blank">Wiki</a>

	 <h2>The Evolution of Gaming</h2>
<p id="evo">Modern gaming did not begin to develop until the creation of war games in the early nineteenth century by Prussian army officers. While inspired by chess, one of the kings of war strategy games for millennia, the war game was more realistic to the battlefield and the troops that were being ordered across them. The benefits of using the war game as a means of battlefield simulation helped “military officers… </p><ul>
<li>[as] an invaluable tool to assist in the preparation and testing of plans and methods and in the training of officers.”</li>
<li>One of the major downsides to the games were their “involving frequently a great many people and requiring considerable amounts of time and resources,” making them useful, but not very often used.</li>
<li>In some cases, however, the time dedicated to the preparation was well worth the effort as officers were able to create new strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite its use in military practice, war games appealed to many civilians with a penchant for military strategy and soon took to playing war games to reenact their favorite military battles. With the addition of chance to the game, usually with dice, the element of surprise soon made the game even more appealing with no one knowing fully how the game would turn out. That soon led to playing the game as though something different happened, altering what could have happened in history. In 1971 the game was altered when Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) published Chainmail, a medieval war game that eventually led to the next great medium of gaming, role-playing.<br>
In 1974, the first copy of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) was published by TSR “at GenCon… in a thousand-copy print run… by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.”4 The duo sought to combine the war games they loved with fantasy, most notably The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien, and to shift the experience from a squadron or three, give or take, to only one person, a hero as it would happen. The result created a new medium that would dwarf its predecessor in popularity.<br>
D&D spawned numerous different editions and expansions, with the original being more of a sword and sorcery style and subsequent releases expanding the settings and environments and even other worlds, and caused many different forms of role-playing games that used the same system or a system very similar to it. Many of the early games in the next major medium, video games, were directly influenced by the early editions of Dungeons and Dragons. Another result of the game was the onset of novels centered around the exploits of gaming groups or even in the world established from previously released novels created from game sessions, “taking place in different worlds that [were] actually different campaign settings.” Movies, comic books, and a cartoon were released based on Dungeons and Dragons, despite the supposed side effects claimed to have occurred during game sessions. The next major medium in gaming, video games, rose in popularity in the 1980s. Some of the best, and worst, early video games had a setting, theme, plot, and/or system mechanic derived from Dungeons and Dragons. Using its predecessor as a model, the video game industry was able to produce many games quickly, soon developing new types of video games and trying out new mechanics to make the gameplay better and more fun, such as controls, combat, storytelling, and aesthetics. Many of the current video games released are influenced more by the previous video game legacies than the predecessors of the video game industry.<br>
War games experienced an addition that helped keep them on the map in 1987 with the creation of Warhammer 40K. The game “is a turn based tabletop war game, set in the far future,” thus adding more fictional elements to the setting of a war game than many of the different kinds before, like different planets, settings, the addition of magic, and even other playable races. As is the case with popular non-digital games, Warhammer 40K has had to make additions and fix a few problems through multiple editions; the game “is currently in [its] fifth edition of rules, races, models, [and] lore.”<br>
Small rectangular pieces of cardboard with pictures and words make the final major medium of modern gaming: trading card games. The game that started trading cards was Magic: The Gathering, a game which is still popular enough to hold tournaments with thousands of dollars being given away to the best person there. The increased acceptance of the fantasy setting, thanks to contributions like Dungeons and Dragons and the Lord of the Rings series, allowed for more fantasy-based games to arise over the years, eventually leading to a portable format. Some have said that “Magic is a mix of poker and chess and Dungeons and Dragons,”<br>
showing the influence such games have had. Magic: The Gathering is the beginning of most of the other trading card games on the market to be what they are, often influencing their mechanics, aesthetics, or other aspects of the game, even if only in the beginning of the design process.

   <h2>Gaming industry</h2>

		 <p>Video games have come a long way since the first games emerged in the 1970s. Today’s video games offer photorealistic graphics and simulate reality to a degree which is astonishing in many cases.<br>
Video games are a billion-dollar business and have been for many years. In 2016, the video game market in the United States was valued at 17.68 billion U.S. dollars. That same year U.S. consumers were said to spend roughly double the amount on gaming content, hardware and accessories. What is important is that the first generation of gamers is now grown up with significant spending power; therefore, despite high penetration rates among kids, video games can no longer be considered solely a child’s play. In fact, it was found that video gaming is gaining on popularity among the seniors in the United States. Fun and mental agility are among the main reasons cited by the older gamers as to why they choose this pastime.<br>
Among the many prosperous representatives of the video game industry are the three major players that have been in the game for decades and remain in the leadership positions as of 2016. Those three are: Sony , Microsoft, and Nintendo. Sony’s PlayStation 4 is the bestseller among current generation consoles. By the end of 2017, it was expected that Sony would sell over 21 million units of the popular console. All three gaming brands are also the most recognized among gamers in the United States, with Nintendo being the frontrunner.<br>
As an example <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/V/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V</a> by Rockstar Games, is the most financially successful media product of all time, selling over 90 million units worldwide and over $6bn in global revenue. It is the fastest selling entertainment product ever, grossing $1bn worldwide in just 3 days and the top selling game of all time in the UK, generating over £240m from more than 6 million physical copies sold - or roughly 3.5 sales per minute (Ukie / GfK), as well as being the top-selling game in the US in terms of both revenue and units. GTAV still continues to defy expectations, returning to the top of the UK chart in March 2018, 4.5 years after it was first launched. <a href="https://www.statista.com" target="_blank">Statista</a></p>

	 <h2>ESports</h2>
	 <p id="sport">ESports (also known as electronic sports, esports, e-sports, competitive (video) gaming, professional (video) gaming, or pro gaming) are a form of competition using video games. Most commonly, eSports take the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players. The most common video game genres associated with eSports are real-time strategy (RTS), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). Tournaments such as The International, the League of Legends World Championship, the Evolution Championship Series and the Intel Extreme Masters provide live broadcasts of the competition, and prize money to competitors.<br>
Although organized online and offline competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events saw a large surge in popularity. Many game developers now actively design toward a professional eSport subculture.<br>
The genre of fighting games and arcade game fighters have also been popular in amateur[citation needed] tournaments, although the fighting game community has often distanced themselves from the eSports label. In the mid-2010s, the most successful titles featured in professional competition were the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games Dota 2 and League of Legends, and the first person shooter game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Other games with significant earnings include Call of Duty, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, Overwatch, Smite and StarCraft II.<br>
In 2013, it was estimated that approximately 71.5 million people worldwide watched eSports. The increasing availability of online streaming media platforms, particularly Twitch.tv, has become central to the growth and promotion of eSports competitions. Demographically, Major League Gaming has reported viewership that is approximately 85% male and 15% female, with a majority of viewers between the ages of 18 and 34. Despite this, several female personalities within eSports are hopeful about the increasing presence of female gamers. South Korea has several established eSports organizations, which have licensed pro gamers since the year 2000. Recognition of eSports competitions outside South Korea has come somewhat slower. Along with South Korea, most competitions take place in Europe, North America and China. Despite its large video game market, eSports in Japan is relatively underdeveloped, which has been attributed largely to its broad anti-gambling laws which prohibit paid professional gaming tournaments. <br>
The global eSports market generated US$325 million of revenue in 2015 and was expected to make $493 million in 2016; the global eSports audience in 2015 was 226 million people. According to a Newzoo report in April 2017, 42% of the gaming market belongs to the mobile industry, and mobile is projected to claim more than 50% the market by 2020.[12][13] The eSports industry is expanding beyond PC and console, as developer Super Evil Megacorp created Vainglory, the first mobile multiplayer online battle arena game, and companies like Skillz bring eSports tournaments to mobile games. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports" target="_blank">Wiki</a></p>

<h2>Positive and negative effects of video games</h2>
<h4>Positive effects of video games</h4>
  <ol class="custom-counter">
		<li>It improves the cognitive functions: According to research conducted by C. Shawn Green, the psychologist of the University of Wisconsin, video games can benefit the teen’s cognitive functions. It changes the brain structure exactly the same way while playing the piano, navigating the map and learning to read. The combination of concentration and the surges of neurotransmitters strengthen the neural circuits that build the brain.</li>
    <li>Hand and eye coordination: Research has shown that teens can learn spatial, visual, and iconic skills from the video games. Some games require a great deal of visual-spatial ability and hand-eye coordination to be successful. The player has to coordinate the brain’s reaction and interpretation with his hands and fingertip movements.</li>
    <li>Quick thinking and accuracy: The action in video games prepares the gamers to make quick decisions. It trains the brain to make fast decisions without losing accuracy. A study has also shown that video games can train surgeons and soldiers.</li>
    <li>Improve your decision making skills: Gaming will improve your child’s decision-making skills. The study has found that teens that play video games made decisions 25% faster without affecting accuracy. Teens adept in gaming can make choices and act upon them six times a second, this is four times faster than normal.</li>
    <li>Encourages teamwork: Multiplayer games that involve cooperation with other online players encourage teamwork in teens. Video games also help teens to make the most of their skills to contribute to the team.</li>
	</ol>
<h4>Negative effects of video games</h4>
<ol class="custom-counter">
	<li>Increases aggressive behavior: Video games with violent content can lead to aggressive behavior in teens. It can also desensitize them to violence. Studies have shown that teens who like playing first-person shooter style games are likely to adopt a detached view of the society. They also develop aggressive thoughts and tendencies.</li>
  <li>Social isolation: Another negative effect of video game is that teens are spending too much time playing games than playing outdoors. Video games are making teens socially isolated. Teenagers who play too much video games are also less likely to indulge in extracurricular activities like reading, writing and participating in sports.</li>
  <li>Teaches wrong values: Besides violent behavior, video game also teaches teens wrong values. Video games portray women as weaker characters. They depict women as helpless and sexually provocative personalities. Teens also pick up bad language and behavior while playing with other people online.</li>
  <li>Poor academic performance: This is one of the serious effects of video games on teens. Playing long hours of video games can affect your teen’s performance in school. If your teen spends more than two hours gaming, then he may have trouble falling asleep and paying attention in school. Video game addicts also skip their homework to play games, leading to a downfall in their grades.</li>
  <li>Adverse effects on health: Excessive gaming can have adverse effects on the teen’s health. Teenagers, by spending too much time playing video games, do not participate in activities that can keep them healthy and fit. It leads to obesity, muscular, skeletal and postural disorders, video-induced seizures, nerve compression and numbness in hands, elbows and shoulders. <a href="http://www.momjunction.com/articles/effects-of-video-games-on-teenagers_00352668/" target="_blank">Source</a></li>

<h2>Piracy</h2>
<p>Even in a modern day world like today, buying a video game costs no less than $50. For some people, even this $50 is too much. This is where piracy gets involved. Piracy means encrypting and hacking software or game and makes it available to people for free. Despite making games and software easy and accessible for a large percentage of people, piracy is an act of crime and according to law, it’s lawfully wrong to change/hack any game or software unless explicit permission is given in it’s licence.<br>
Video game piracy has an old history. Since the existence of video games, piracy has existed. Sections and experts related to cyber security condemn and declare the illegitimate use of software against the owners’ copyrights as an act of crime. For as long as piracy of games is known, gamers, developers, and the industry members have argued on the topic whether pirating hurts the legitimate sale and profits of games or not.<br>
A study showed that the average age of the demographic that pirate games is between 16–35 years of age. Unsurprisingly most of the consumers of pirated games have an average household income of less than $25,000 annually. However, what is surprising is that there are still consumers with an average yearly income of over $150,000 that still pirate games. The majority of those that use pirated games were within the US at 36.4% of those surveyed, followed by the UK at 13.3%. Strangely, 34.8% of all surveyed still agreed that piracy was wrong, with 21.6% agreeing piracy is wrong, but that they still do it anyway. 22.7% said their morels are based on who developed the game.<br>
Piracy is popular because, for a large number of people, it’s the only way to play and enjoy games. Piracy has played a huge part in bringing games to the farthest end of the world but it has damaged the gaming industry as well. Despite of all the efforts made by major players in this industry, piracy has still caused a loss of $74 billion in total revenue of gaming industry in 2016.<br>
There are a lot of ways to control and minimize game piracy. Measures must be implemented in order to save the gaming industry from huge losses. Experts believe that with the adoption of emerging technologies, the piracy will be ended in the next two years. <a href="https://medium.com" target= _blank>Source</a></p>

 <div id="seventh">
<h2>Video game addiction </h2>
<p>Video game addiction (VGA) has been suggested by some in the medical community as a distinct behavioral addiction characterized by excessive or compulsive use of computer games or video games that interferes with a person's everyday life. Video game addiction may present itself as compulsive gaming, social isolation, mood swings, diminished imagination, and hyper-focus on in-game achievements, to the exclusion of other events in life.<br>
In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) declined to include video game addiction in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, concluding that there was insufficient evidence to include it as an official mental disorder. However, proposed criteria for "Internet Gaming Disorder" were included in a section called "Conditions for Further Study".<br>
While Internet gaming disorder is proposed as a disorder, it is still discussed how much this disorder is caused by the gaming activity itself, or whether it is to some extent an effect of other disorders. Contradictions in research examining video game addictiveness may reflect more general inconsistencies in video game research. For example, while some research has linked violent video games with increased aggressive behavior other research has failed to find evidence for such links. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_addiction" target="_blank">Wiki</a></p>
<p>This kind of addiction can have very serious consequences. Here are few real live situations as an example:
	<ol class="custom-counter">
		<li>•	Gamer Brian Vigneault died after playing an online game called War of Tanks for nearly 24 hours. Vigneault was raising money for the Make-A-Wish foundation during his marathon. When he stopped to take a smoke break, he had a massive heart attack and died.
According to a friend, Vigneault had not slept for 22 hours and was drinking Five-Hour Energy and Red Bull to stay awake.</li>
 		<li>•	Two Taiwanese men died from marathon gaming binges within three weeks of one another in 2015. The first was a 38-year-old man who was found dead after playing video games for five days straight in an Internet cafe in Taipei. The second was Hsieh, a 32-year-old man who died from cardiac arrest after playing for three days without stopping.
Even worse, workers at the Kaohsiung Internet cafe didn't discover that Hsieh was dead for hours. He'd been known to sleep face down on the table during his gaming binges, but when workers found him sprawled out and unresponsive, they finally sent him to the hospital. Authorities believe that cold temps and over-exhaustion were to blame. They noted that none of the other games in the cafe seemed to even notice that one of their own was being carted off, stiff as a board, by paramedics.
If there's a lesson to be learned (besides "don't play video games for days without stopping to sleep or eat"), it's this: don't get caught in an emergency around gamers. Unless your dying body impedes their ability to play, they might not be any help at all.</li>
		<li>•	The earliest known deaths to have occurred while playing video games are attributed to Jeff Dailey and Peter Burkowski who both expired (they didn't die, they expired) while achieving fantastically high scores on the popular arcade title Berzerk, by Atari.
In 1981, Dailey popped a quarter into the robot-killing machine to score an alleged 16,660 points, his personal best. Moments later, he collapsed and was pronounced dead of a heart attack at the tender young age of 19.
Burkowski died under similar circumstances less than a year later when, after frequenting his local game room "Friar Tuck's" in Calumet City, Illinois for months, he finally pushed himself too far. Shortly after entering his initials on the Berzerk score board for not one but two record high scores, he also fell victim to cardiac arrest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These cases are like very extreme examples, but for others gaming could be just another part of their daily activity.</p>

<h2>What is role of modern gaming in our lives?</h2>
<p>Social aspect of gaming in 2018 remains controversial. Some of older people are thinking that gaming and all the people who games a lot are sick, they waste their time and that gaming is only for children, all gamers are losers, and lonely people etc.... So called “no lifers” spending entire days in different kind of virtual words can’t even imagine their lives without video games. Every person chooses for himself. But in nowadays life when money decides everything you just can’t ignore whole industry of gaming (generating Billions of $) and people who in any way are participating in it. Here are some interesting statistics about gaming and gamers:</p>
<ol class="custom-counter">
	<li>Just how popular are video games, really? 49% of American adults play video games “on a computer, TV, game console, or portable device like a cellphone,” but only 10% consider themselves gamers.</li>
	<li>Who plays more games, men or women? While 60% of American adults believe that “most people who play games are men,” gender actually has little to do with whether or not you game: “A nearly identical share of men and women report ever playing video games (50% of men and 48% of women).”</li>
	<li>Gender does seem to impact whether or not you consider gaming a part of your identity. “Men are more than twice as likely to call themselves ‘gamers’ (15% vs. 6%). This is especially true among young adults, ages 18-29. 33% of men in this age range “say the term ‘gamer’ describes them well,” but only 9% of young women.</li>
	<li>The debate about video games and violence, although less prominent in the media than it once was, is actually still alive and well, even among gamers. Only “a slight majority of the public (53%) disagree with the statement ‘people who play violent video games are more likely to be violent themselves.’ 40% believe there is a relationship between game-world violence and life-world violence, even 32% of folks who play games themselves.</li>
	<li>There is still a video game stigma. 26% of people think “video games are a waste of time.” And “30% of adults do not think most games are a better form of entertainment than TV, almost triple the 11% who think this is true.”</li>
	<li>Few people believe in the benefits of video games, even despite all the articles I’ve written describing the research. When asked if “games help develop good problem solving and strategic thinking skills,” 17% agreed this was true about most games and 16% thought it was not. Almost half, or 47% believed “this is true of some games but not others.” 20% were unsure.</li>
	<li>Are gamers loners? 23% of people do not believe that games “promote teamwork and communication.” While only 10% believe they “do promote these qualities.” 37% thinks it depends on the game.</li>
	<li>On the portrayal of minorities in video games…47% are “unsure if most games portray minorities poorly.” 23% think they do not, 20% say sometimes, and only 9% see the portrayal of minorities in games as problematic.</li>
	<li>On the portrayal of women in video games…40% are unsure whether or games portray women poorly. 18% say it is “not true for most games.” 14% say most games do indeed include problematic representations of women. 27% say it depends on the game. Also, there is no difference between how men and women answered this question. <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org" target="_blank">Source</a></li>
